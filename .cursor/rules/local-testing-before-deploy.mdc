# Local Testing Required Before Deploy

- Never deploy changes until thorough local testing is completed and the feature is confirmed working.
- Use production-matching conditions where possible (Docker + Python 3.11 + prod-like env vars).
- Capture proof of local test output in the relevant `.md` log file for the iteration.
- Only deploy after user explicitly approves.

## Example (Required Sequence)

```text
1) Update code
2) Run local tests in Docker (prod-like)
3) Record results in a .md file
4) Ask for explicit approval
5) Deploy
```
