# Constitution Accountability Agent

An AI-powered personal accountability system that enforces adherence to a Life Constitution through daily check-ins, pattern detection, proactive interventions, and gamification -- all delivered via a Telegram bot running on Google Cloud.

## What This Does

You define a personal Life Constitution -- a set of non-negotiable rules for sleep, training, deep work, discipline, and boundaries. This agent enforces those rules by:

- **Daily Check-ins:** 6 Tier 1 yes/no questions + 4 reflective questions every evening at 9 PM
- **Quick Check-ins:** A streamlined Tier 1-only check-in (limited to 2 per week) for busy days
- **Compliance Scoring:** Calculates a 0-100% score based on how many non-negotiables you hit
- **Streak Tracking:** Consecutive-day streaks with a 48-hour grace window, recovery tracking, and streak shields
- **AI Feedback:** Personalized, constitution-aware feedback generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash after every check-in
- **Pattern Detection:** Scans your history for 9 types of negative patterns (sleep degradation, training abandonment, porn relapse, compliance decline, deep work erosion, snooze pattern, consumption vortex, boundary violations, ghosting)
- **Proactive Interventions:** Sends you Telegram messages when dangerous patterns are detected, before they spiral
- **Emotional Support:** CBT-style emotional processing via a dedicated agent when you're struggling
- **Weekly Reports:** AI-generated reports with 4 visualization graphs and insights every Sunday
- **Achievements & Gamification:** 15+ unlockable achievements, streak milestones, and celebrations
- **Accountability Partners:** Link with another user for mutual accountability and notifications
- **Data Export:** Export your check-in history as CSV, JSON, or PDF reports
- **Leaderboard & Social:** Compete on a global leaderboard, invite friends via referral codes, and share stats

## Architecture

```
User --> Telegram App --> Webhook --> FastAPI (Cloud Run)
                                         |
                                    Bot Handler
                                         |
                              Supervisor Agent (intent classification)
                                         |
                  +----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
                  |          |           |           |           |
              CheckIn    Query     Emotional    Pattern     Reporting
              Agent      Agent      Agent      Detection     Agent
                  |          |           |           |           |
                  +----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
                                         |
                              Firestore + Gemini 2.5 Flash
```

**How the agent routing works:**

The Supervisor Agent classifies every incoming message into one of four intents -- `checkin`, `query`, `emotional`, or `command` -- and routes it to the appropriate specialized agent. Each agent has access to Firestore for persistent state and Gemini for AI generation. This is a custom multi-agent architecture (no LangChain dependency) for maximum control and minimal cost.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Runtime** | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, uvicorn |
| **AI** | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via `google-genai` SDK) |
| **Database** | Google Cloud Firestore (Native mode) |
| **Infrastructure** | GCP Cloud Run, Cloud Scheduler, Secret Manager |
| **Interface** | Telegram Bot (`python-telegram-bot` 21.0) |
| **Visualization** | matplotlib, Pillow, reportlab |
| **Containerization** | Docker (python:3.11-slim) |

### Data Model

All data is stored in Firestore with the following collections:

| Collection | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `users/` | User profiles, streaks, timezone, career mode, achievements, partner links |
| `daily_checkins/{user_id}/checkins/{date}` | Individual check-in records with Tier 1 responses, compliance scores |
| `interventions/` | Pattern-triggered intervention messages sent to users |
| `reminder_status/` | Tracks which reminders (9 PM, 9:30 PM, 10 PM) have been sent per user per day |
| `emotional_interactions/` | Logged emotional support conversations |
| `patterns/` | Detected pattern records for longitudinal analysis |

## Features by Phase

### Phase 1 -- MVP Check-In System (Complete)

The foundation: a Telegram bot that asks you 6 Tier 1 non-negotiable questions (yes/no) plus 4 reflective questions each evening, calculates compliance, and tracks your streak.

**Tier 1 Non-Negotiables tracked:**
1. Sleep 7+ hours last night
2. Completed training (or scheduled rest day)
3. 2+ hours of deep work / focused study
4. 2+ hours of skill building (adapts to career mode)
5. Zero porn today
6. Maintained boundaries (no toxic interactions/sacrifices)

**Additional reflective questions:**
- What challenges did you face today?
- Rate today 1-10 on constitution alignment
- What's tomorrow's #1 priority and biggest obstacle?

**Core logic:**
- **Compliance score:** `(items_completed / total_items) * 100`
- **Streak rules:** Increments if check-in within 48 hours of last check-in; resets otherwise
- **Duplicate prevention:** Cannot check in twice on the same calendar day (IST)
- **3 AM cutoff:** Check-ins after midnight but before 3 AM count toward the previous day

### Phase 2 -- AI Feedback & Pattern Detection (Complete)

Added intelligence to the system. Every check-in now receives personalized AI feedback that references your constitution, and a background scanner detects negative behavioral patterns.

**AI Feedback:** After each check-in, Gemini 2.5 Flash generates a short, personalized response that considers your constitution, current streak, compliance history, and the specific items you missed. The tone is supportive but firm -- like a coach who believes in you but won't tolerate excuses.

**Pattern Detection (9 types):**

| Pattern | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| Sleep Degradation | Sleep missed 3+ of last 5 days |
| Training Abandonment | Training missed 3+ of last 5 days |
| Porn Relapse | Porn reported 2+ of last 7 days |
| Compliance Decline | Average compliance dropping over 7 days |
| Deep Work Erosion | Deep work missed 3+ of last 5 days |
| Snooze Pattern | Sleep inconsistency detected |
| Consumption Vortex | Multiple non-negotiables slipping simultaneously |
| Boundary Violations | Boundaries missed repeatedly |
| Ghosting | No check-in for 3+ consecutive days |

**Intervention Agent:** When patterns are detected, the agent composes and sends a proactive Telegram message. Interventions are logged in Firestore to avoid sending duplicate warnings.

**Scheduled scanning:** A Cloud Scheduler cron job triggers `/trigger/pattern-scan` every 6 hours to check all users for emerging patterns.

**Cost optimization:** The system uses approximately 150 tokens per check-in, costing ~$0.000022 per interaction ($0.0036/month for daily use) -- 166x cheaper than the original budget target.

### Phase 3A -- Multi-User, Reminders & Timezone Support (Complete)

Transformed the single-user bot into a multi-user system with timezone-aware reminders.

**Multi-user onboarding:** New users go through a guided `/start` flow that collects their name, timezone (auto-detected from Telegram with manual override), and constitution mode (Optimization / Maintenance / Survival).

**Triple reminder system:**
- 9:00 PM local time -- Friendly reminder
- 9:30 PM local time -- Nudge
- 10:00 PM local time -- Urgent reminder

**Timezone-aware scheduling:** A cron endpoint (`/cron/reminder_tz_aware`) runs every 15 minutes. It buckets users by their IANA timezone and sends reminders at the correct local time -- supporting 60+ timezones worldwide.

**3 AM cutoff:** Check-ins completed between midnight and 3 AM are counted toward the previous day, acknowledging that late-night check-ins still belong to "today."

### Phase 3B -- Emotional Support & Accountability Partners (Complete)

**Emotional Support Agent:** A dedicated agent powered by Gemini that uses CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) techniques to help process difficult emotions. Triggered by the `/support` command or automatically when the Supervisor detects emotional distress in a message.

**Accountability Partners:**
- `/set_partner <telegram_id>` -- Send a partnership request
- Partner receives an accept/decline inline keyboard
- Once linked, partners receive notifications when the other completes a check-in or misses a day
- `/partner_status` -- View your partner's latest stats
- `/unlink_partner` -- Dissolve the partnership

### Phase 3C -- Achievements & Gamification (Complete)

**15+ Achievements** across three categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Streak** | First Check-in, 7-Day Streak, 30-Day Streak, 100-Day Streak |
| **Performance** | Perfect Day (100% compliance), Perfect Week, Consistency King |
| **Special** | Early Bird, Comeback Kid (recovery after streak break), Night Owl |

**Streak Shields:** 3 shields per month that can be used to protect your streak when you miss a day. Use with `/use_shield`. Shields reset monthly.

**Milestone Messages:** Celebratory messages at key streak milestones (Day 3, 7, 14, 30, 50, 100, etc.) with recovery milestones when rebuilding after a streak break.

**Recovery Framing:** When a streak resets, the bot frames it as a "Fresh Start" rather than a failure, with recovery milestones tracking progress toward surpassing your previous streak.

### Phase 3D -- Career Mode & Skill Building (Complete)

**Career Mode:** Three modes that adapt the 6th Tier 1 question:
- `skill_building` (default): "Did you spend 2+ hours on skill building today?"
- `job_searching`: "Did you spend 2+ hours on job search activities today?"
- `employed`: "Did you complete a meaningful professional development activity today?"

Switch modes with `/career` (shows inline keyboard) or `/mode` for constitution mode.

**Backward Compatibility:** Check-ins before Phase 3D (which added the 6th Tier 1 item) are scored with /5 instead of /6, so historical compliance percentages remain accurate.

### Phase 3E -- Quick Check-in & Stats Commands (Complete)

**Quick Check-in (`/quickcheckin`):** A streamlined check-in that only asks the 6 Tier 1 yes/no questions -- no reflective questions. Limited to 2 per week to encourage full check-ins most days. Weekly count resets every Monday at midnight.

**Stats Commands:**
- `/weekly` -- Compliance trend, streak info, and item-by-item breakdown for the past 7 days
- `/monthly` -- 30-day overview with averages and trends
- `/yearly` -- 365-day longitudinal summary

**Correction Command (`/correct`):** Fix mistakes in today's check-in by toggling individual Tier 1 items via an inline keyboard. Automatically recalculates compliance score.

### Phase 3F -- Export, Visualization, Reports & Social (Complete)

**Data Export (`/export`):**
- **CSV:** Spreadsheet-compatible export of all check-in data
- **JSON:** Machine-readable full export
- **PDF:** Formatted report with graphs, statistics, and AI-generated insights

**Visualization (4 graph types):**
- Sleep compliance trend (line chart)
- Training consistency (bar chart)
- Overall compliance over time (line chart)
- Tier 1 item breakdown (radar/spider chart)

**Weekly Reports (`/report`):**
Generates a comprehensive report with all 4 graphs plus AI-written analysis of your week. Also triggered automatically every Sunday at 9 AM via Cloud Scheduler (`/trigger/weekly-report`).

**Social Features:**
- `/leaderboard` (alias `/rank`) -- Global leaderboard ranked by streak and compliance
- `/invite` (alias `/refer`) -- Generate a referral link/code to invite friends
- `/share` (alias `/brag`) -- Generate a shareable stats card with QR code

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11+** installed
2. **Google Cloud Platform** account with:
   - Project created (e.g., `accountability-agent`)
   - Firestore database in Native mode
   - Service account with JSON key (for local development)
   - APIs enabled: Cloud Run, Firestore, Vertex AI, Secret Manager
3. **Telegram bot** created via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

### Local Development

#### 1. Clone and set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/accountability_agent.git
cd accountability_agent

python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values:
#   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
#   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_user_id
#   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=.credentials/your-service-account.json
```

**To find your Telegram Chat ID:**
1. Send any message to your bot
2. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates`
3. Look for `"from": {"id": 123456789}` in the response

#### 3. Verify Firestore connection

```bash
python -c "from src.services.firestore_service import firestore_service; print('Connected!' if firestore_service.test_connection() else 'Failed')"
```

#### 4. Run tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Specific test categories
pytest tests/test_compliance.py tests/test_streak.py -v  # Unit tests
pytest tests/ -m integration -v                           # Integration tests
```

#### 5. Run the bot locally

**Webhook mode (requires ngrok):**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Expose to internet
ngrok http 8000

# Set webhook
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/setWebhook?url=${NGROK_URL}/webhook/telegram"
```

**Then test in Telegram:** Send `/start` to your bot to begin onboarding.

## Deployment to Cloud Run

### 1. Build and push container

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project accountability-agent

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/accountability-agent/constitution-agent:latest
```

### 2. Deploy

```bash
gcloud run deploy accountability-agent \
  --image gcr.io/accountability-agent/constitution-agent:latest \
  --region us-central1 \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars "ENVIRONMENT=production,GCP_PROJECT_ID=accountability-agent,WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-cloud-run-url.run.app"
```

Secrets (bot token, chat ID) should be stored in GCP Secret Manager and mounted as environment variables.

### 3. Configure Cloud Scheduler

Set up these cron jobs in GCP Cloud Scheduler, each calling the Cloud Run URL with an `X-Cron-Secret` header:

| Schedule | Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Every 15 min | `/cron/reminder_tz_aware` | Timezone-aware check-in reminders |
| `0 */6 * * *` | `/trigger/pattern-scan` | Scan all users for behavioral patterns |
| `0 9 * * 0` | `/trigger/weekly-report` | Generate Sunday weekly reports |
| `0 0 * * 1` | `/cron/reset_quick_checkins` | Reset weekly quick check-in counts |

### 4. Verify deployment

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-cloud-run-url.run.app/health

# Check webhook
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getWebhookInfo"

# View logs
gcloud run logs read --service accountability-agent --region us-central1 --limit 50
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/health` | None | Health check (returns Firestore connection status) |
| `POST` | `/webhook/telegram` | Telegram | Incoming bot updates |
| `POST` | `/cron/reminder_tz_aware` | `X-Cron-Secret` | Timezone-aware reminders |
| `POST` | `/cron/reset_quick_checkins` | `X-Cron-Secret` | Weekly quick check-in reset |
| `POST` | `/trigger/pattern-scan` | `X-Cron-Secret` | Background pattern detection |
| `POST` | `/trigger/weekly-report` | `X-Cron-Secret` | Generate weekly reports |
| `GET` | `/admin/metrics` | Admin | System metrics (request counts, latency, errors) |

## Rate Limiting

The bot implements a 4-tier rate limiting system to prevent abuse and control AI costs:

| Tier | Cooldown | Commands |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Expensive** | 10 min | `/report`, `/export` |
| **AI-powered** | 40 sec | `/checkin`, `/quickcheckin`, `/support` |
| **Standard** | 3 sec | `/status`, `/weekly`, `/monthly`, `/achievements` |
| **Free** | None | `/start`, `/help`, `/mode`, `/career` |

Admin users (configured via `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`) bypass all rate limits.

## Monitoring

```bash
# Live log tail
gcloud run logs tail --service accountability-agent --region us-central1

# Recent logs
gcloud run logs read --service accountability-agent --region us-central1 --limit 50

# Service status
gcloud run services describe accountability-agent --region us-central1
```

In production, the app uses JSON structured logging for easy parsing in Cloud Logging. The `/admin/metrics` endpoint exposes in-memory counters for request counts, latency percentiles, and error rates.

**Expected monthly cost:** ~$0.55/month for a single user (well within GCP free tier). AI costs add ~$0.004/month.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (50+ tests)
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/test_compliance.py tests/test_streak.py tests/test_ux.py -v

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/ -m integration -v
```

**Test coverage breakdown:**
- Unit tests: compliance scoring, streak logic, timezone utils, UX helpers
- Service tests: Firestore operations, analytics, achievements, exports, visualization
- Agent tests: check-in feedback, intent classification, reporting
- Bot tests: command handlers, conversation flow
- Integration tests: end-to-end flows, phase-specific features

- Weekly and monthly reports require Cloud Scheduler to be configured for automatic delivery

**Planned for Phase 4:**
- Full ghosting escalation protocol (Day 3, 5, 7 alerts)
- Mode auto-switching based on date ranges (surgery recovery)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Voice check-in support
