## 📝 Recommended Commit Message

```bash
git commit -m "Phase 3E + Security: Quick check-ins, Query Agent, Stats, and comprehensive security hardening

Phase 3E Features:
- Implemented quick check-in mode (Tier 1-only, 2x/week limit, abbreviated AI feedback)
- Added Query Agent for natural language data queries (6 query types)
- Created stats commands (/weekly, /monthly, /yearly) with instant summaries

- Scrubbed all secrets from documentation (bot tokens, API keys)
- Deleted .env.bak file created during deployment
- Added 2 Cursor rules for automatic security enforcement (project + global)
- Created comprehensive security audit documentation

Documentation:
- 14 Phase 3E documentation files (implementation, testing, deployment)
- 3 bug fix documentation files
- 5 security documentation files
- Updated main implementation plan

Deployment:
- Deployed to Cloud Run (revision 00029-vvz)
- Configured Telegram webhook
- Set up Cloud Scheduler cron job (reset-quick-checkins)
- All health checks passing

Testing:
- 17/17 automated tests passed (100%)
- Local Docker testing completed
- All features verified in production

Cost Impact: ~$90/month for 1000 users (optimized with fast detection and abbreviated feedback)"

## 🧪 Pre-Commit Verification

**Run these checks one final time:**

```bash
# 1. Check what's being committed
git status

# 2. Review changes
git diff --cached | head -100

# 3. Scan for any remaining secrets (should be 0)
git diff --cached | grep -E "[0-9]{8,10}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35}" | wc -l

# 4. Verify no .env files
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "\.env"

# 5. Check .gitignore is staged
git diff --cached --name-only | grep .gitignore
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 36 files staged
- ✅ 0 secrets found
- ✅ 0 .env files
- ✅ .gitignore included

---

## 🎯 After Commit

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify on GitHub
- Check repository is updated
- Verify no secrets visible
- Confirm .gitignore working

### 3. Test Cursor Rules
- Open a different project
- Ask AI about committing .env files
- Verify global rules are working

### 4. Monitor Production
- Check Cloud Run logs
- Test Phase 3E features via Telegram
- Verify cron job scheduled
